# Project 3: Identifying the Melting Temperature of Different Models of Ice Using Gromacs
In this github I am going to be providing all my code, workflow, and analysis that I used to identify the melting temperature of TIP4P (for this project).
|      | My Work   | Literature|
|-----:|-----------|-----------|
| TIP4P| 300       | 230       |

## Overview
I started with a perfect crystal of ice which was generated from ðŸš¨ link here
For this project I ran 2 minimization and 1 equilibration step that did not change, the production step had several variations. 
1. Minimization
2. Equilibration: for the equilibration step I did the temperature and the pressure equilibration together (see **Trouble Shooting** section for details)
3. Production
For the analysis, I looked at Q6 and the potential energy.
**All files mentioned can be found on GitHub**

## Input Files
### .mdp
### Topology

## Anaylsis
### Potential Energy
### Q6

### Deccorrelation Time
### Free Energy Difference???

## Gromacs Version and Specifications
### Borah Specifics
#### Loading Modules
`module load gromacs+plumed/2024.5/openmpi/4.1.3/gcc/12.1.0`

`which gmx_mpi`: `/cm/shared/apps/gromacs+plumed/2024.5/openmpi/4.1.3/gcc/12.1.0/bin/gmx_mpi`

`which plumed`:`/cm/shared/apps/plumed/2.9.3/openmpi/4.1.3/gcc/12.1.0/bin/plumed`

`gmx_mpi --version`: See [This gromacs text file](gromacs_spec.txt) file

#### Gromacs Commands
`gmx_mpi energy -f prd.edr -o prd`
This puts out an .xvg file, that contains whatever info you ask it for, I typically asked for PE, KE, T, Pressure, Density, and System T.
#### Plumed Commands
`plumed driver --plumed plumed_xtc.dat --mf_xtc prd.xtc`

## Trouble Shooting
### Ringing with Temperature Equilibration
Shown in the image below we can see *ringing* in the temperature as I am trying to equilibrate the system. This oscillation does not diminish even over long simulation times (the mosth I tried was 1E6 steps). This caused the system to melt long during the equilibration step which made it impossible to do the analysis I wanted to.

### Finding the Barostat
### Superheating
At first I was a little concerned that my temperatures did not match the literature values
